# Analysis code for "Cancer tolerance to chromosomal instability is driven by Stat1 inactivation _in vivo_"

> Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of cancer, but also an instigator of
> aneuploidy-induced stress, reducing cellular fitness. To better understand
> how cells with CIN adjust to aneuploidy and adopt a malignant fate in vivo,
> we performed a genome-wide mutagenesis screen in mice. We find that
> specifically aneuploid tumors inactivate Stat1 signaling in combination with
> increased Myc activity. By contrast, loss of p53 is common, but not enriched
> in CIN tumors. Validation in another tissue type confirmed that CIN promotes
> immune cell infiltration, which is alleviated by Stat1 loss combined with Myc
> activation, but not with p53 inactivation, or Myc activation alone.
> Importantly, we find that this mechanism is preserved in human aneuploid
> cancers. We conclude that aneuploid cancers inactivate Stat1 signaling to
> circumvent immune surveillance.

This repository contains all analysis code, but we are still in the process of
cleaning it up.
