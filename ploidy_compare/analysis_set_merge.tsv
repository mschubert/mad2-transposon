417s	417s-low	1	
446s	446s-high	1	S-phase sorted? but fit well with RNA
446s	446s-low	0	low population ok
449s	449s-high	2.5

477t	477t-high	2	RNA-seq looks clonal, sure we did T there and not S?
477t	477t-low	1	20x difference between day of low+high sort, why?
489s	489s-high	0	population not sorted
489s	489s-low	1	RNA-seq is clonal IGKV and close to euploid
613t	613t-high	1	only one population present, same ploidy
613t	613t-low	1	only one population present, same ploidy
